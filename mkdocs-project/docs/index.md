# Open Water Foundation / Learn GeoProcessor #

This documentation provides resources to learn how to use the OWF GeoProcessor software,
which automates processing of spatial data.

This documentation has been written based on experience using the GeoProcessor at the Open Water Foundation.

**The GeoProcessor software is currently under development at the Open Water Foundation.
Documentation and tests are being published to facilitate collaboration and evaluation by potential software users.
The software will be published as an open source software project once a critical mass of initial functionality is
in place, with appropriate tests and documentation.**
