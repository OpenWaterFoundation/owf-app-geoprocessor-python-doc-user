# GeoProcessor #

This is the user documentation for the Open Water Foundation (OWF) GeoProcessor software.
The GeoProcessor software provides features that:

* automates spatial data processing using a workflow command language with simple syntax
* edits and runs workflows, and displays results
* reads, processes, and writes spatial data layers from various sources
* reads, processes, and writes data tables from various sources
* includes an integrated testing framework to validate the GeoProcessor software and workflows

The GeoProcessor software when used for spatial data processing is installed after installing one of the following
geographic information system (GIS) software frameworks,
which provide spatial data processing functionality via Python version 3 libraries.

* free and open source [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) - **this is the primary version for development**
* commercial [ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/) - **this is updated once features are added to the QGIS version**

The GeoProcessor can also be installed as a testing framework without using the above software.
The testing framework allows creating software tests without programming.

The GeoProcessor is particularly useful when workflows need to be standardized as part
of a business process or analysis effort.
The workflows can be shared with team members working in different
organizations, different operating systems, and different GIS environments.
The GeoProcessor is also useful for completing one-off tasks, prototyping workflows,
and checking other software tools and processes.

Additional product information can be found in the [Introduction](introduction/introduction).
