## Overview ##

Keyhole Markup Language (KML) is an [Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. (OGC)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/) international standard file format that allows geographic data to be consumed by a 2D or 3D earth browser. Popular earth browsers include [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/) and [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps). 

The following are resources that explain the specification:

* [Google's KML Reference Guide](https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference)
* [OGC KML Standards](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml)


## Limitations ##

The following are limitations of KML files:

1. KML files must be projected in [World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84)](https://confluence.qps.nl/qinsy/en/world-geodetic-system-1984-wgs84-29855173.html).
2. KML has very limited support for metadata as recommended by ISO 19115 or FGDC. - [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000340.shtml)
