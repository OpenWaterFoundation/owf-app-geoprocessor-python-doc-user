# Learn GeoProcessor / Install GeoProcessor #

The GeoProcess installation requires that the following components are installed:

* [Install QGIS](#install-qgis)
* [Install Python (Optional)](#install-python-optional)
* [Install GeoProcessor](#install-geoprocessor)

----------------------

## Install QGIS ##

The GeoProcessor installation requires that QGIS is installed.
See the [Resources](resources#QGIS) information for how to install QGIS.
It is recommended that QGIS be installed in the default location to minimize configuration issues.

## Install Python (Optional) ##

The GeoProcessor requires Python 2.7+.
The `gp` program that runs the GeoProcessor typically uses the Python distributed with QGIS.
However, it may be appropriate to use a different Python (need to evaluate this).

## Install GeoProcessor ##

Need to provide instructions for how to install.

* Virtual environment?
* Pip install into QGIS?
* Pip install into other Python?
