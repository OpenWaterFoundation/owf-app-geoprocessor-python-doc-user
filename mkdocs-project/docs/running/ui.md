# GeoProcessor / Running / User Interface (UI) #

The GeoProcessor user interface (UI) is run using the `gpui` script (Linux) and `gpui.bat` batch file (Windows).
The following are considerations specific to this variant:

* Use the ***File / Open / Command File...*** menu to open a command file.
* See the [`gp` Command Line Options](overview#geoprocessor-gp-program-options),
such as `-p`, which can be used to specify additional environment properties for `gpui`.

If the testing framework variant of the GeoProcessor is used,
see the [documentation for running UI in the testing framework](gptest).
