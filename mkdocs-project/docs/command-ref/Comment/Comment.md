-------------------------

## Overview ##

Single-line comments start with `#`.
Spaces and tabs before the comment character is allowed.
Comments cannot be added after commands - comments must exist on their own command line.

## Command Editor ##

The following dialog is used to edit the command and illustrates the command syntax.

**Need to implement UI.**

## Command Syntax ##

The command syntax is as follows:

```text
# A comment
# Another comment
     # An indented comment.
```

## Examples ##

See the [automated tests](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-app-geoprocessor-python-test/tree/master/test/commands/Comment).
