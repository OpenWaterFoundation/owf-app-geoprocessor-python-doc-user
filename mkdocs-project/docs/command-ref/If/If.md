## Overview ##

**This command is not fully implemented.**

The `If` command evaluates a conditional statement and if true will result in the commands between
`If` and matching `EndIf` being executed. Matching `Name` parameter for the `If` and `EndIf`
commands defines a block of commands. Currently, there is no “else if” or “else” syntax and nested
`If` commands must be used to evaluate complex conditions. The syntax for the conditional statement
is restricted to a simple comparison:

```
Value1 operator Value2
```

The values can be integers, floating point numbers, Boolean values, strings, or processor properties that
evaluate to these types. The operator is one of the following (more functionality will be added in the
future). For Booleans, False is less than True. For strings, A is less than Z, etc.

* `<`
* `<=`
* `>`
* `>=`
* `==` (use this to test equality – do not use a single equal sign)
* `!=`

All nested `If` commands must evaluate to true to execute the commands within the deepest level of
nesting. Some commands set a property that
can be used for checks, for example to see if the number of features in a GeoLayer is nonzero.
It is helpful to use the [`Message`](../../Message/Message) command to print a message to the log file and help control whether
a warning or failure status should occur as the result of the `If`.

## Command Editor ##

The following dialog is used to edit the command and illustrates the command syntax.

**Need to implement UI.**

## Command Syntax ##

The command syntax is as follows:

```text
If(Parameter="Value",...)
```
**<p style="text-align: center;">
Command Parameters
</p>**

| **Parameter**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | **Description** | **Default**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
| --------------|-----------------|----------------- |
| `Name` | The name of the `If` command, which will be matched with the name of an `EndIf` command to indicate the block of commands in the if condition. | None - must be specified. |
