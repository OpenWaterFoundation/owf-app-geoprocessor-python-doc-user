-------------------------

## Overview ##

Multiple-line comments start with `/*`.
Spaces and tabs at the start of the comment line are OK.
Additional text after the comment indicator is allowed.

## Command Editor ##

The following dialog is used to edit the command and illustrates the command syntax.

**Need to implement UI.**

## Command Syntax ##

The command syntax is as follows:

```text
ACommand(...)
AnotherCommand(...)
/*
ACommentedCommand(...)
AnotherCommentedCommand(...)
*/
```

The commands between `/*` and `*/` lines will be recognized as commands but will not be run.

## Examples ##

See the [automated tests](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-app-geoprocessor-python-test/tree/master/test/commands/CommentBlockStart).
